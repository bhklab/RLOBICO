Title: R-LOBICO: an R package for building logical models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bo Li
Maintainer: The package maintainer <li1033889482@gmail.com>
Description: The package applies LOBICO model to large and complex datasets, formulates the logic mapping as an integer linear programming problem (ILP), and uses the advanced ILP solvers (IBM ILOG Cplex) to find the optimal mapping. The package is developed using R and C++, where the logic mapping formulation and Cplex Solver are implemented as separate files by C++ for performance gain and R functions are used as wrappers to call the C++ functions in the package. The speed performance of our open source package is optimized by tuning relevant parameters of Cplex Solver, which leads to a better performance than the standard Matlab package.
