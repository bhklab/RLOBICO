Description: Applies LOBICO model to large and complex datasets, formulates the 
  logic mapping as an integer linear programming problem (ILP), and uses the 
  advanced ILP solvers (IBM ILOG Cplex) to find the optimal mapping. The package
  is developed using R and C++, where the logic mapping formulation and Cplex 
  Solver are implemented as separate files by C++ for performance gain and R 
  functions are used as wrappers to call the C++ functions in the package. The 
  speed performance of our open source package is optimized by tuning relevant 
  parameters of Cplex Solver, which leads to better performance than the 
  standard Matlab package; it is described in:
