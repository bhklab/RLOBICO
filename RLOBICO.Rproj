Title: Fast Logical Models Implemented with IBM CPLEX
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bo Li
Maintainer: The package maintainer <benjamin.haibe-kain@utoronto.ca>
Description: Applies LOBICO model to large and complex datasets, formulates the logic mapping as an integer 
  linear programming problem (ILP), and uses the advanced ILP solvers (IBM ILOG Cplex) to find the optimal mapping. The 
  package is developed using R and C++, where the logic mapping formulation and Cplex Solver are implemented as separate 
  files by C++ for performance gain and R functions are used as wrappers to call the C++ functions in the package. The 
  speed performance of our open source package is optimized by tuning relevant parameters of Cplex Solver, which leads 
  to a better performance than the standard Matlab package.
